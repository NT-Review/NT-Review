#### Description:

I love books. They have the ability to capture everything, yes, everything, such as our five senses. A book can make you hungry, can make you feel the waves in the ocean, can make you hear the beautiful sound of the jungle, can make you smell the scent of Christmas, and can make you see a whole new world in front of youâ€”until you realize that you are in the kitchen at that moment. 

I love computer science and books, so I want to do something that can combine them both. That is why I chose to create a website, a book review website. 

So to summarize, this website has 5 pages: the homepage, about, reviews, authors, and finally contacts. 

There isn't much of a page on the homepage. It's a welcome page. From here, you might be confused for a moment about where to go next, but if you look closely at the top, you can see a navigation bar that can direct you to any pages that you want. If you want to go back to the homepage (for any reason, I don't know), then you just need to click on the logo itself. 

About: This section describes who I am and why this website exists. 

Reviews: This is the main thing on the website. On this page, you can see a variety of book reviews that I've written. All of the book reviews are for books that I've finished reading. If you notice, there will be a pink (I spent hours choosing the color of this button) button that has an up arrow. If you click on it, it will automatically scroll up to the top.

Authors: A list of authors is provided so that you can easily determine whether your book is on this website (after all, you know who the author of your book is, right?) 

Contact: So you can reach out to me if you have any problems. 

That's basically everything I want to say about my website. Hopw you enjoy looking at my reviews!
